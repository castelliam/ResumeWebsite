				<h3>How It All Started</h3>
				<p>I was not always the eager student I am today. When I started programming, I was a Junior in high school. I decided to stop taking french, which meant, I had to sign up for a different elective. Thinking Computer Science would be dealing with Word and Excel, I thought, "Yeah, I'll be good at that." Was I wrong or what?</p>
				<p>For the entire year, I struggled every single day. I had a friend that kept me going and practicing. I also has a relentless teacher that I will never forget. He forced me to see him every morning before class and while it did help, I slinked into the room each morning, dreading the time I was in there. By the end of that year, I had rasied my grade, made a leap frogger game in Java, and was ready to go ahead and struggle through the next class. </p>
				<p>Since then, programming has been the only subject in school that I've wanted to work hard for, even when I was struggling. Now, in CODEcamp, I'm learning more than I could've hoped and loving every minute of it. People laugh when I joke around with other members around the Corridor about how great it would be if we had CODEcamp lockins and reward a pin every time a student finishes a class. But, in all serious, it has made me even more passionate and excited about start into a career pursuing Computer Science.</p>
				<p>I am in for a lifetime of all the challenges and excitement that this field has to offer.</p>
